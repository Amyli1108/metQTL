This repository contains scripts related to "Mapping the plasma metabolome genome for 40 human diseases: linking genetic risk to disease endpoints"

The code and scripts in this repository describe the core analysis done for the paper and other analysis described in the paper can be easily derived from any of the scripts.   Please keep in mind that this code has been written to run on the system of the Wuhan University and requires dedicated input files, which are not always sharable due to privacy reasons, e.g., individual level genotypes. While the authors are happy to answer questions, there will be no active maintenance of the code stored.
